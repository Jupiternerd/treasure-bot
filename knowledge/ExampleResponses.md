Can you share more about the experience you’re having? If this event is one where their venue map is included in the vendor registration, you’d have to select a table from the map before going to checkout.

Hi!

Adam from the team at Treasure here! I noticed that you posted a show on the platform, and I wanted to reach out. I would really appreciate the chance to chat if you have 15 minutes any day this week or next to chat about what we offer for organizers!

I want to ensure that you're getting as much value from our platform as you can, and that I address any questions or concerns you might have. If you have the time, you can schedule time directly in my calendar here, or just let me know and I can send over an invite!

Looking forward to hearing from you, and good luck with the show!

Did you check your spam folder for the tickets? Sometimes they end up there. If they are not there, I can search up your order if you confirm the phone number or email they were purchased with.

Merge Account No Activity

Hi,

Because your account tied to your phone number had no activity on it, I was able to go ahead and delete the account associated with your phone number. Now you'll be able to add it to your main account from your edit profile page!

How to set up scanners on app

First step would be them making an account at ontreasure.com/login

Then, you can add their account as a scanner on your event team from the manage team page.

Finally, they can download the mobile app and then sign in with the account you added as a scanner:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/treasure-events/id6670620747

When they open the app on their phone they’ll see the button to scan. Each person who purchased a ticket will have a QR code in their email that can be scanned at the door
